		//if you want to print your web page source, there is a rule, you can use you page source to search for an item for an example if you are looking for a person id
		//if you are unable to get the page source when you right click you can say:
		System.out.println(driver.getPageSource()); //this is how you will print page source
		
		driver.get("http://yahoo.com");
		//if you landed in a different page and for an example you want to go back you simply do thi:
		driver.navigate().back();
		
		//this is what you will use if you want to go foward:
		driver.navigate().forward();
		
		//so if you want to close the web driver:if you are working on a single page
		driver.close();
		driver.quit(); //it closes all the browser opened by selenium script,this will close child windows
		
		//locaters
		driver.get("http://facebook.com"); //this actually opens the url of the browser
		//once we entered in the facebook web page we are interested in entering your id in the email and password fields
		
		driver.findElement(By.id("email")).sendKeys("this is my first code");//selenuim will go to the facebook page and search for the field id that contains email
